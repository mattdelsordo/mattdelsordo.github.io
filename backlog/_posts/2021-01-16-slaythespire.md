I'm a big fan of deckbuilding games so I had a really good time with _Slay the Spire_. I didn't think I was that in to roguelikes, but between this and _Hades_ maybe I'm coming around. As with _Hades_, you don't really mind dying since it just means you get to try out a new strategy and explore new card interactions. I also really like how each character has such a distinct playstyle while the fundamental game mechanics stay more-or-less constant. Unlike _Hades_, there isn't much of an overarching plot to keep you coming back for more - it's much more of an arcade-y experience to play in bursts when your in the mood. I think that if I had this game growing up I would have **devoured** it on long card rides. The only thing I didn't really like is the art direction, which feels cheap and kind of amateurish. That's not really the point of the game though, and you can tell that the devs put a ton of thought into the mechanics and game design and that more than makes up for it.
