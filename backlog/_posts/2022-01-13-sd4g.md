_Speed Dating for Ghosts_ might sound like some silly _Hatoful Boyfriend_ type thing, or that dating sim where you date tanks or whatever, but it's actually really earnest. The game explores some legitimately serious and heartfelt topics through conversations with its vibrant characters. Each ghost you meet has a different relationship to death and life, and learning more about them and going on dates with them is entertaining and enriching. My favorite was Spooky Peter, the ghost who died during the black death and now haunts professionally and gives you haunting lessons. Steph and Dave were also up there, and their stories destroyed me. The writing is great overall, and while the graphics are very simple, the visuals are clean and stylish. A lot is conveyed by the shape of speech bubbles and character-specific dialogue fonts. The sound design is also great, I love a game where each character has a unique text-display noise in place of voice acting. The stuff they do with the music really adds to the experience so definitely play this one with the sound on. _Speed Dating for Ghosts_ gets my recommendation if you're looking for something short and sweet.
