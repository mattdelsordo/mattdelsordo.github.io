Not sure when I acquired this game but it's free on Steam and I never actually played it. Really charming little heist game. The narrator adds a lot of drama. I especially loved the bit where you have to sneak through the vault, and Dr. Langeskov is a great character. I wasn't so hot on the tiger chase part though, my leg ended up crippled and it made the rest a slog. I don't have a ton more to say because it's a very short game that you should really play yourself to get the full effect. I _did_ use a guide to get all the achievements, which honestly I don't recommend.
