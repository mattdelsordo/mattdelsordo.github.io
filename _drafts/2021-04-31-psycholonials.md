# TODO:

- Sarah Z's video that touched on Hussie's wild behavior really recontextualized a lot of the things I was going to write about and I feel completely differently about Psycholonials after watching it. Not sure if the sort of weird psychoanalysis that I would want to do is cool

- psycholonials floats this concept of memetic imperialism, where the only way for alien species to propagate their society is to hijack the societies of other aliens lightyears away
- they do this with a set of ideas that are so powerful in themselves that they spread throughout entire populations once introduced, with a minimum of input from the person seeded with the ideas in the first place
- Is psycholonials Andrew Hussie's Turtles All The Way Down? In terms of being a work that he made to explore/was impacted by his own internet fame. I think Lidsay Ellis's book may have themes like this as well
- If so it implies that Hussie is kind of working through what he wrought with homestuck. Did he mean to do that, was it designed in such a way as to have this rabid, uncontrollable fanbase? Or did he discover that as he went along by making something that appealed to his own interests? I feel like probably the latter
- Thesis: Homestuck's insane fanbase is a direct consequence of its composition, and it was inevitable that it would end up like that once it got even a little popular due to its inherent memetic quality
  - Young fanbase:
    - main characters are teens, but plot has enough adult themes e.g. high violence, references to more millennial media than gen Z media, that teens feel like they're reading something transgressive/for adults. It's hosted on its own website so school administrators don't know enough about it to block it and prevent people from reading it at school. Tackles a lot of themes that appeal to teens such as growing up, understanding your identity, having responsibility dumped on you unexpectedly.
    - young fans have a lot of time on their hands to engage with the fanbase
  - ease of replication
    - simple art/designs makes fanart/self-insert OCs SUPER easy
    - very easy/cheap to cosplay which leads to very visible fans doing free advertising basically
  - high levels of creator engagement with the community
  - frequent but erratic update schedule drives hype and drip-feeds content to keep people hooked, act of refreshing the site taps into the brain's gambling urge
  - fanfic encouragement - there are tons of CANON AUs/timelines to fit your own stories within
  - inherent confusingness/cult-esque shit
    - confusing plot generates high levels of discussion/fan theorizing
    - completely opaque to outsiders, creates in-group/out-group dichotomy
  - actual interesting storytelling/quality writing
  - discourse - no such thing as bad press
    - did he know vriska generating discourse was driving new engagement with homestuck? was the "caucasian" thing a bridge too far?
    - was the shipping chart shit on purpose?
