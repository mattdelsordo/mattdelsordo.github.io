# TODO:

1. is there any way I can salvage this?
2. not sure if its even worth posting since the cats fever has died

Big ups to my uncle for the Fandango gift cards that allowed me to go see _Cats_ in theaters last weekend. Definitely I spent those in an enriching and worthwhile way. Tessa and I might have been the only sober people in that theater. There was heckling galore, everyone wanted it to be a _Rocky Horror_ screening so bad.

This is not my _Cats_ take. There are so many _Cats_ takes and I cannot compete with them. Instead, I want to dive into the implications of one specific Cat: Macavity, the production's villain, in the film played by a way-too-naked Idris Elba. Sung by Taylor Swift, Macavity's song goes like this:

```
Macavity's a Mystery Cat: he's called the Hidden Paw -
For he's the master criminal who can defy the Law.
He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair:
For when they reach the scene of crime - Macavity's not there!

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity,
He's broken every human law-
```

and that's where I'm going to pause this one because that's the point at which I stopped paying attention to the movie and started thinking about how powerful Macavity must be to break **every** _human_ law.

As you might expect, I'm not the first to think about this. The following meme is one of the top posts on r/catsthemusical, for instance:

But I think we can go deeper.

_Cats_ is based off a T.S. Eliot poetry collection called _Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats_, published in 1939. These poems act as the lyrics for every musical number in _Cats_. We can therefore assume that _Cats_ takes place in or before 1939. As with my post about _Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat_ I'm going to be focussing on _Cats_ the movie in this post because it's what I've seen, and my memory of the movie's sets supports this 1939 hypothesis. Therefore, for Macavity to have broken a law, said law must have been extant somewhere in the world during that timespan. If we say that _Cats_ takes place in _exactly_ 1939 and Macavity is around 7 years old ([middle-aged-ish for a cat](https://www.catster.com/cat-health-care/average-lifespan-of-a-cat)) then we can assume that Macavity has broken every law on the books anywhere in the world between the years of 1932 and 1939. This leaves out a lot of modern campaign finance legislation but does include most of the content of the Geneva Conventions.

Now you can meme all day about the absurdity of a cat committing tax fraud, but I find the implications of that crime more interesting. If we take it to be true that Macavity has broken every law then it follows that he must have some pretty crazy feats and abilities. This is completely in character, because if we take only the feats that we can see Macavity perform in _Cats_, we already know that he can:

- levitate
- warp himself and others to new locations
- extreme alertness (he's always wide awake!)
- higher than average mental acuity for a cat (he plays cards)

So he is obviously some sort of cat sorcerer. As an example of how breaking every law expands this list, take the following law from the United Kingdom: it's illegal for your pet dog to mate with a royal pet dog. If we take it as a fact that Macavity has broken this law, we then know that:

1. Macavity has subjugated (enslaved?) a dog, an animal that other Jellicles are shown to have trouble dealing with.
2. Macavity has gotten this dog close enough to the royal family for it to have sex with a royal dog. His teleportation/levitation abilities probably helped a lot here.

Before I continue: my girlfriend's interpretation of the "he's broken every law" line was that it was a joke about how little cats understand human law, but I disagree. There is nothing figurative in the movie _Cats_. This is a movie that took a visual gag where a performer removes her cat costume to reveal a fancier showgirl cat costume and turned it into a cat literally peeling her skin off, and then did it a SECOND TIME later on in a way that affects the plot of the movie, just to reinforce that it was not a joke, this cat CAN molt.

## Jack of All Trades

There are a lot of laws that apply only to specific tradespeople. You can't violate food safety laws if you aren't selling food! Thus, in his short seven years Macavity must have held nearly every single existing job. This includes but is probably not limited to:

- All government positions including head of state
- Soldier
- Parent
- Butcher
- Landlord
- Bootlegger (US prohibition was lifted in '33)
- Debt collector
- Doctor/Pharmacist/Snake oil salesman
  At the same time there are a lot of consumer protection laws that didn't exist until the second half of the 21st century, so Macavity has probably done less crime in this category than you'd expect.

## A Monster of Depravity

## Logistical Genius and/or Sorcerer

## God's Law

Has Macavity violated every law in Leviticus? I was thinking about this and I think it comes down to whether or not divine law counts as "human law". Thomas Aquinas did not think so, and according to early Christian doctrine God's law and human law are two different things, and by this logic Macavity has only broken the biblical laws that were also secular laws in the 1930s. Other faiths view this topic differently, however.
