# TODO: watch the threepenny opera film on the criterion collection

wild that there's so many covers of music from this, though I've never heard anyone talk about it. was it more well known in previous generations? did it get like, red scared? it really wears its politics on its sleeve. what's with that? I think you could really adapt this well to a modern setting, some of the songs are kind of bops
why the fuck did they do a big band cover of Mack the Knife? gangster vibe shit? is this knowable?
