Half Life is just so simple compared to a lot of games today. The simplicity of the UI and the gameplay itself go a long way to enhance immersion, which is surprising for a game where everyone is so polygonal. It just made me think about, like, people have been innovating in game design for decades, and not all of it really stuck, so it's cool to go back and play games that did things that subsequent developers never replicated.
