# TODO:

1. I was very drunk when I wrote this initially
2. research history of the girlification of the unicorn. was it always associated with little girls, or is that a modern (80s?) construction?
3. What were perceptions of the unicorn in medieval scotland/europe?
4. History of hornily comparing men to horses?
5. Gonna have to read something about phallic imagery lol
6. interesting that modern masculinizations of the unicorn go forward, increasing the cartoonishness for humor, rather than rein in the fae aspect to revert it to just like a horse with a sword

_Warning: this post contains a lot of me talking out of my ass._

It seems to me that unicorns, in American culture, are synonymous to some extent with femininity. Case in point here is My Little Pony, but just run an image search for "unicorn" and tell me how many images AREN'T little girl toy coded. Where did that start? I started thinking about this when I was studying abroad in Scotland, whose national animal is the unicorn, if you didn't know.

![[WALES MOM SAID IT WAS MY TURN ON THE FANTASY NATIONAL ANIMAL](https://www.discoverbritainmag.com/the-unicorn/)](/img/unicorn/scottish_unicorn.jpg)

Clearly the unicorn wasn't ALWAYS a vector for female-coded childrens' marketing, I mean this is a country whose other national symbol is rugged mountain men with huge swords. In the grand scheme of symbolic British politics, what is Scotland's unicorn doing standing toe-to-toe with the Irish elk, British lion, and the Welsh _dragon?_

This inspired me to use a Galarian Rapidash when I played Pokemon Shield. And look at this guy: rainbow unicorn coded as hell but ready to beat ass:
![Garyl is done with your bullshit](/img/unicorn/rapidash.png)
Look at this thing's eyes. The thing looks like it WILL gore you with it's huge, black, ~blood-soaked~ horn.

What happened to make horses a stereotypically girly thing? Wherefore came the horse-girl stereotype? In past generations horses were symbols of wealth and prestige and vectors for military strength.

Maybe I'm just reading some weird stuff, but there's a lot of overlap in how sexually powerful men are described in fiction and how one would describe a particularly quality horse. Rippling muscle, huge size, sweat born of ecstatic physical exertion. These are stereotypically manly traits. And then on top of that, the unicorn is given a horn, both a phallic symbol and a weapon. Man-coded x2.
