# TODO:

1. Add into explaining that this is really old and unsourced
2. Maybe try to find the book I sourced a new time?
3. Clean this up to match new standards

Last year I had the amazing opportunity to participate in a combo study abroad/internship program in Edinburgh, Scotland. The following post is adapted from a talk I wrote but never gave while working at [St Cecilia’s Hall: Concert Room and Music Museum](https://www.ed.ac.uk/visit/museums-galleries/st-cecilias).

If you are friends with a euphonium player, you will probably have heard them have to explain to someone what exactly that is. This is our curse, and our burden. If you weren't a band kid and don't know, it's this:
![](euphonium.jpg)

It sort of looks like a small tuba, which is mostly correct. Euphoniums tend to get lumped together with tubas, mostly because there aren't enough of the former to have their own dedicated groups, most of the time.

These, however, are _not_ euphoniums:
![](baritone, alt horn, etc.)

You might be wondering: why on earth not? How and _why_ are they differentiated? I'm going to try to explain.

First, a bit of background. The way brass instruments work, you buzz your lips into a mouthpiece, and the sound wave you produce with your lips travels through the instrument and produces a pitch relative to the length of the tube. If you've never done it before, try doing this with a used-up paper towel tube, your dog will go crazy. You can't actually produce every note doing this, and there are music theory and physics reasons as to why, but to keep it simple, the notes you can produce correspond to the length of the tube you're making noise into. In order to play more notes, you have to change the size of the tube, preferably at the same time as playing the instrument. The first way people figured easily do this was by putting holes in the tube. By uncovering these holes the tube length is effectively shortened and the sound wave in the tube is modified. So, say you want a low “brass” instrument that can play more than like seven notes? You get the serpent!
![](serpent.jpg)

All it is is a big long tube with some holes in it, and it has the fun shape so that the player can reach all the holes, which have to be placed at strategic spots in order for notes to come out in tune. If you notice, the tube also gets wider as it goes on, which is referred to as a “conical bore,” and results in a warmer sound quality than the consistently-wide “cylindrical bore” of a trumpet or trombone. According to what I’ve read, serpents had a unique sound compared to the brass instruments of today. Unfortunately the remaining instruments have not aged well, and there aren’t really any remaining serpent virtuosi out there, so you can’t really get the original serpent experience like you could if you visited a church service in the 1700s.

The serpent was used in place of the tuba right up until the 19th century, but went out of style because it’s honestly kind of ridiculous to play. Finger holes, for one thing, have to be as large as possible and at very particular spots to be effective and play notes in tune, which really flies in the face of a human hand properly covering all of them. Makers generally had to compromise, and go for easy of playability over consistent tone. Additionally, the serpent’s shape, and the fact that it was made of wood, did not mix well with the need to play in groups outdoors that became a thing with brass bands in the 1800s. The solution to these problems was the ophicleide:
![](ophicleide.jpg)

"Ophicleide" is Greek for “keyed serpent” which is basically what it is - they took a serpent, folded it in half, made it out of metal, and put keys on it. This made it much easier to hold, allowed it to be played outside (metal fares better in the rain), and levered keys allowed its holes to be of any size and position, improving pitch quality.

Ophicleides were a big improvement on serpents and used as a bass, baritone, and tenor brass voice in a lot of early 19th century orchestral music, but had their own issues. Keys don’t work as well with brass instruments as with woodwinds for a number of reasons, chiefly that the change in air stream direction caused by opening and closing large holes necessitate a certain level of skill on the part of the player to maintain an even tone. There was also an issue of key, basically brass instruments of this era could only play in one key at a time which could be modified by swapping out a “crook” which lengthened the tube and caused the instrument to produce a different fundamental pitch. Keys and holes, however, have to be at specific locations based on the pitch of the instrument in order to produce expected, in-tune notes, so if you added a crook, all of the fingerings would change, if all the fingerings produced in-tune notes at all.

The serpent family of instruments began to fade into obsolescence after the invention of modern piston valves in 1815. Rather than modifying the sound wave by letting air escape the instrument, valves redirect air through a new section of the tube, thereby lengthening the instrument by a predefined amount.
![](valve schematic)

Valves let brass instruments play any note in their range and in any key and allow for a more consistent sound across notes because they simply change the tube length of the instrument rather than disrupt the air column. Resulting instruments were also easier to play and easier to make. Everyone went crazy over these new valves and just started slapping them on everything, most famously Adolphe Sax, of saxophone fame, who “invented” the saxhorn family of instruments in the mid-1800s:
![](saxhorns.jpg)

Saxhorns are essentially all the same valved brass instrument but with different choral voices, so we have an alto one, a tenor one, a bass one, etc. I say Sax “invented” these, with the air quotes, because basically everyone in Europe was making variants on this theme at the time. The saxhorn-esque design is the logical endpoint of trying to make a bugle of a given pitch with a given number of piston valves. Enough people made their own variants of these instruments that we don't call most of them "saxhorns" in American English: a tuba, for instance, is broadly equivalent to a bass saxhorn, a flugelhorn is a soprano saxhorn, and a baritone Bb saxhorn, with a conical bore, is more or less a euphonium. Valved brass instruments of the euphonium's pitch and range lack the same level of standardization that trumpets or violins have, and different places have their own names for minute variations on the instrument, all which share the same musical function. This leads to the classic confusion between "euphoniums" and "baritone horns": the only difference is the shape and size of the tubing, which lead to tone qualities that are preferred in different settings The profusion of broadly similar mid-range brass instruments has always been confusing and led to a lot of lawsuits in the mid-1800s.

To finally answer the central question of this spiel: the euphonium is a tenor, valved, conical-bore bugle. It has the same range as a trombone but trades the trombone's bright sound and godlike loudness for a more mellow tone and the potential for more intricate finger-work. These differences lead to the euphonium being used frequently as a solo instrument in wind and brass band music, and it's commonly used to mimic or double the human singing voice.

Today, old ophicleide parts tend to be played by the tuba as the tuba is the closest thing to it that orchestras tend to have on staff. I (and others) (mostly euphonium players) would argue that a better substitution would actually be a euphonium, as it more closely matches the ophicleide's range, tone color, and musical role. The euphonium is the ophicleide's true successor, yet, somehow, the euphonium has been relegated to wind and brass bands exclusively. On behalf of euphonium players who have to learn the trombone to play with jazz bands and orchestras everywhere, I encourage you to call your friendly neighborhood ensemble and demand more euphonium representation. Maybe then some day the euphonium will ascend to the conical tenor brass instrument throne, as is its birthright.
