Well that was weird. _Kids_ is an "interactive animation" that I feel belongs on an iPad at the MoMA. Presentation-wise, the black and white visual style that seamlessly blends the interactive and non-interactive parts is fun to watch. All the little dudes have very smooth animations and every movement has an associated sound. At parts, it's basically a fluid simulation but with small little guys for particles. I'm not sure what _Kids_ is trying to convey, but it filled me with a weird dread, an _End of Evangelion_ emotion where you're not sure what you're looking at but it's vaguely organically shaped and primally worrying. I started out sending dudes into the big hole willy-nilly but by the end I was like... do I have to? Why? Where are they going? This seems... bad somehow. Did some of them just manage to escape? Is it like a...birth metaphor? A death metaphor? Something about leadership, and lemming-like mobs following blindly to their demise? \~Art.\~
