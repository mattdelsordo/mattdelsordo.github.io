Groovy! I have mixed feelings about this one. On one hand, the graphics and animations are GORGEOUS. I love this game's aesthetic, it's well done and well suited to the genre. I really missed the tiny sprite art dudes when I played _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_, and playing this was like, ooh baby, the tiny dudes are back. There's just so much character to how each unit type attacks and defends. I love how much flavor each faction's units have even though they're mechanically identical, for example the dogs:

Did I mention the scout units are all dogs? It's great.

I haven't gotten in to this aspect of _Wargroove_ but my understanding is that it's very moddable, with a lot of room for stuff like custom maps and campaigns, and I think that is really cool. You can sort of feel how the extensibility is reflected in the game design. Maps are made up of tiles with a discrete and defined set of properties and each opponent has the same set of units with the same set of capabilities (other than the unique commanders). As far as I can tell, there isn't a ton of AI rule-breaking to serve the story and I think that's neat, it makes it feel fair and kind of chess-like relative to something like _Fire Emblem_.

_Wargroove_'s gameplay does kind of annoy me though. It's a pretty hard game, which is fine in itself, but the punishment for failure is just _rough_, because these levels can get _long_ and you have to start them all over if you lose. There are times where I felt like I'd maybe screwed up badly enough to soft-lock myself, but then thought _maybe_ I could pull it off, and then the next twenty minutes of game would confirm I really should have quit and not wasted my time. I think I might be playing too recklessly, personally, but playing sufficiently safely seems like it would be tedious. I have a lot of room to improve so I intend to revisit this game, eventually. For now I am too tilted to keep going.
